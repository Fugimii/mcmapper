# mcmapper
✨A python program to render birds eye view pictures of your minecraft world✨

If you want to use it right now you will need to put a world in the directory this repository is in and then run `main.py` and make sure to install [amulet-core](https://github.com/Amulet-Team/Amulet-Core)

### TODO:
- [ ] Get colours working(HOW DO I GET THE COLOURS???)
- [ ] A launcher type thing that lets you change settings
- [ ] Allow selecting worlds from the .minecraft/saves folder
- [ ] Allow changing where the worlds are selected from for custom launchers and custom instances
